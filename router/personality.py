# In PostgreSQL, your table would look like this:
# CREATE TABLE personality_questions (
#     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
#     trait VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL, -- 'O', 'C', 'E', 'A', 'N'
#     question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
#     is_reverse_scored BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
# );

# For high-performance read-heavy operations where questions rarely change, 
# a static dictionary loaded into memory is an architecturally sound starting point.
